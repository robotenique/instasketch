the credentials above to log in as a student or teacher. The page also has a create account and forgot
id/password link.

Clicking 'Create Account' takes you to the registration page. This page has the space for you to register
on InstaSketch. You can input the following values to create your accounts.

meant to be sent to the email with the password. Currently it does not send a mail (no server interaction).

#### Student

- Sketchbook (sketchbook.html):

This is the first view a student can see when logged in. The sketchbook is the basis of our
application, where the student can do his/her sketches. The functionalities of our sketchbook
are to choose between 8 predefined colors, 4 different thickness for the brush, an eraser,
undo and redo function and clear the Sketchbook (all done in the javascript). Each item can be
clicked on to be selected. The sketchpad is the white area where you can click and drag to use
the currently selected brush to draw.

The student can give a title to the sketch in a text box below the sketchpad. They can choose a
session from a drop down list if he/she wants to, and click on submit, which will prompt
a confirmation to save the new drawing. The drawing is saved as an SVG image and the sketchpad is
cleared so the student can start again.

The pages have a navigation bar at the top with a few options. The final one at the far right, highlighted,
is the one currently active (sketchbook). You can click on the others to go to the relevant pages. Click on
the profile on the navbar to view the student's profile.

- Profile (studentProfile.html):

The profile page for the student gives the student the option to check his own profile, as well
as modify his own info. By clicking the edit button beside each attribute, the student can edit the
information stored about themselves. They can modify all attributes freely except for their teacher. Since their
teacher has to be one from the school, the new teacher can only be one that already exists. So when changing the teacher's name,
you can write either Dumbledore's name or Mark's name, but none others will work. The profile picture can also
be changed by clicking on the picture and selecting a new one locally. It is stored as a link in the javascript but
that is meant to be simulating what will likely happen with the picture's retreival from the server.

You can click then click on the My Drawings link on the navigation bar to see the drawings from this student.

- My Drawings (mydrawings.html):

This page shows the student the latest drawings they made, where they can click on the drawing and open the
image in a new tab. This page also shows whether the drawing was submitted (sent to a session) or
is a free drawing (not submitted).

You can then click on the Submissions link on the navigation bar to see the submissions from this student.

- Submissions (mysubmissions.html):

The submissions page has all of the submissions made by this student. It contains the submitted drawings, the name
of the session that the student submitted the drawing to, and the teacher's comments on the drawings. If the
teacher commented something, the text is there. If they did not, there is an empty box.

That's the web experience from the student side. Click Logout in the footer of the page and log in as a teacher using
the credentials given above.

#### Teacher

- My sessions (mysessions.html):

This is the page a teacher starts off at after logging in. It shows a list of the sessions that the teacher opened.
The session boxes show whether a session is currently open. If so, the teacher has the ability to close it. You can close
the Animals session. There is also a button to make a new session (the blue +). You can click it and enter a new session name
of Planes to create a new open session. The new session can be seen in a new tab as well as in the My Sessions page.

Click the submissions page to see the submissions from the students and mark them.

- Submissions (teacherSubmissions.html)

The submissions page has all the submissions from the students. The teacher can click on each image to view the drawings. The
submissions show the name of the student that submitted the drawing and a box for the teacher to give feedback. The teacher can\
simply write in the boxes and press the submit button to record their changes to the student's submissions.
Feel free to write as you will in the submissions boxes.

Click on the Profile link in the navigation bar to see the teacher's profile.

- Profile (teacherProfile.html):

The profile page for the teacher shows their own profile, as and lets them modify their own info, in the same way a student can.
The teacher does not have the 'teacher' field that a student profile does and thus no restrictions on how they are able to modify
their attributes.

Finally, the teacher can click on the Administration link in the navigation bar to manage their students.

- Administration (admin.html):

This page shows the current students registered in a table, with the basic information. The teacher can then:
    - Delete a student (Clicking on the option 'Remove' in the respective student)
    - Modify a student: This opens a new page (modifyStudent.html), where the teacher can modify the attributes
                        of the selected student just as if it were the student itself doing so. Click the Modify button on 
						the first student. It takes you to his profile where you can change things.Making these changes
						will not affect anything since the information is not carrying over between pages with servers.
    - Add a new student: The teacher can add new students directly too. After clicking on the Add button, it opens a page
						like the registration page where you can enter the following information:
						First Name: Harry		Last Name: Potter			Rest of the information: Any possible values
						Click the Finish button and then see the new student on the list (duplicated admin page).

You can click the About Us link in the footer to see a summary of what InstaSketch can do for both students and teachers.
