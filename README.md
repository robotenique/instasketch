# Setup

In the **instasketch** folder (the one with *package.json* file) run (in the terminal):

```bash
$ npm install
```

The mongodatabase is located in the cloud, so if you want to change the code or the project to what you want, it's recommended to use a local mongo database.



### Run the application

Make sure that you have the required packages, then run the following command in the *instasketch* folder.

```bash
$ node app.js
```
