### Instructions and Functionality

HEROKU URL: http://fierce-beach-87457.herokuapp.com/

The first page you'll see after opening the application is the login page. This page is where you can use
the credentials above to log in as a student or teacher. The page also has a create account and forgot
password link for students.

First you'll need to create the accounts, one for a student and one for a teacher (the admin). 
Clicking 'Create an account' takes you to the registration page. This page has the space for you to register
on InstaSketch. You can input the following values to create your accounts. Create the teacher account first,
then the student.

Teacher:
    - First Name: Horace
    - Last Name: Slughorn
    - E-mail: horace.slughorn@utoronto.ca
    - Password: horace123
    - School: UofT Primary School
    - Province: Ontario
    - Teacher Code: horaceteach
Student:
    - First Name: Juliano
    - Last Name: Garcia
    - E-mail: juliano.garcia@mail.utoronto.ca
    - Password: blahblah
    - School: UofT Primary School
    - Province: Ontario
    - Teacher: Horace Slughorn

Clicking the submit button registers the user and takes you back to the login page.

For students, clicking on the 'Forgot password' link takes you to a page where you can enter your e-mail, which will
notify the student's teacher that this student has requested a new account, which the teacher can then create.


#### Student

- Sketchbook (/sketchbook):

This is the first view a student will see after logging in. The sketchbook is the basis of our
application, where the student can do his/her sketches. You can choose between 8 predefined colors, 
4 different thickness settings for the brush, an eraser, undo, redo and clearing the sketch (all done in the javascript). 
Each item can be clicked on to be selected. The sketchpad is the white canvas where you can click and drag to use
the currently selected brush to draw.

The student can give a title to the sketch in a text box below the sketchpad. They can choose a
session from a drop down list if he/she wants to, and click on submit, which will prompt
a confirmation to save the new drawing. The drawing is saved as an SVG image and the sketchpad is
cleared so the student can start again.

The pages have a navigation bar at the top with a few options. The final one at the far right
is the one currently active (sketchbook). You can click on the others to go to the relevant pages. Click on
the profile on the navbar to view the student's profile.

- Profile (/student-profile):

The profile page for the student gives the student the option to check his own profile, as well
as modify his own info. By clicking the edit button beside each attribute, the student can edit the
information stored about themselves. They can modify all attributes freely except for their teacher. Since their
teacher has to be one from the school, the new teacher can only be one that already exists. The profile picture can also
be changed by clicking on the picture and selecting a new one locally.

You can click then click on the My Drawings link on the navigation bar to see the drawings this student has made in
the sketchbook.

- My Drawings (/drawings):

This page shows the drawings the student has made, with the most recent ones appearing first. You can click on the drawing 
to open the full size image in a new tab. This page also shows whether the drawing was submitted to a specific session or
is a free drawing (not submitted). It also tells you when the drawing was created.

You can then click on the Submissions link on the navigation bar to see the submissions from this student.

- Submissions (/student-submissions):

The submissions page has all of the submissions made by this student. It contains the submitted drawings, the name
of the session that the student submitted the drawing to, and the teacher's comments on the drawings. If the
teacher commented something, the text is there. If they did not, there is an empty box.

That's the web experience from the student side. Click Logout in the footer of the page and log in as a teacher using
the credentials given above.


#### Teacher

- My Sessions (/sessions):

This page shows a list of the sessions that the teacher opened. The session boxes show whether a session is currently open, as well
as how many of the submissions to that session that the teacher has graded so far. If the session is open, the teacher has the ability 
to close it, preventing students from making further submissions to it. 

There is also a button to create a new session (the blue + on the bottom-right). You can click it and enter a new session name of Planes to 
create a new open session. The new session can be seen in a new tab as well as in the My Sessions page.

- New Session (/newsession)

This is the page that automatically opens in a new tab when the teacher creates a new session. The purpose of this page is to display
the name of the new session in large text, to show the students which session they should submit their drawings to.

Click the submissions page to see any submissions from students and mark them.

- Submissions (/teacher-submissions)

The submissions page has all the submissions from this teacher's students that the teacher has not yet graded. The teacher can click 
on each image to view the drawings. The submissions show the name of the student that submitted the drawing and a text box for the 
teacher to give feedback. The teacher can simply write in the boxes and press the submit button to record their changes to the student's 
submissions. Feel free to write as you will in the submissions boxes.

Click on the Profile link in the navigation bar to see the teacher's profile.

- My Profile (/teacher-profile):

The profile page for the teacher shows their own profile, and lets them modify their own info, in the same way a student can.
The teacher does not have the 'teacher' field that a student profile does and thus no restrictions on how they are able to modify
their attributes.

Finally, the teacher can click on the Administration link in the navigation bar to manage their students.

- Administration (/admin):

This is the page that a teacher starts off at after logging in.

It shows the teacher's current students registered in a table, with their basic information. The teacher can then:
    - Delete a student: Click on the option 'Remove' in the respective student
    - Modify a student: This opens a new page (/modify-student), where the teacher can modify the attributes
                        of the selected student just as if it were the student itself doing so. Click the Modify button on 
                        the first student. It takes you to his profile where you can change information.
    - Add a new student: The teacher can add new students directly too. After clicking on the Add button, it opens a page
                         like the registration page (/admin/addStudent) where you can enter the following information:
                         First Name: Harry       Last Name: Potter           Rest of the information: Any possible values
                         Click the Finish button to redirect back to the main admin page to see the new student on the list.

You can click the About Us link in the footer to see a summary of what InstaSketch can do for both students and teachers.
